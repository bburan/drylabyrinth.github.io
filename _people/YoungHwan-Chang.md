excerpt: "Our current research area aims to develop a general framework for quantifying multi-scaling imaging. Special emphasis will be on developing a novel image analysis tool to understand spatial distribution of cancer cells and their interactions. We will use and adapt state-of-art machine learning/deep learning techniques for exploratory data analysis by rigorous data integration."
