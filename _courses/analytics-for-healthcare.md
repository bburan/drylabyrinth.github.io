CRN: BMI 524/607
Instructors: [Abhijit Pandit, M.B.A., Tracy Edinger, N.D.] 
Credits: 3.0
Content: "This course is a broad overview of how analytics is used in healthcare settings. While analytics can take many forms we primarily focus on the use of this framework to advance the goals of healthcare organizations. We attempt to cover the process, infrastructure needs, tools, skills, organization, people and governance to effectively perform this work in a healthcare organization. We do not focus on particular quantitative methodologies and therefore our course should be considered 'non-technical'. Instead we provide a broad overview of the field with exposure to several common tools and software packages. This course is designed for CI-major students."
