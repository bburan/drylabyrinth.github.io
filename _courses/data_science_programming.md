title: Data Science Programming
description: "This course is a best-of compilation of concepts, practices, and python- and R-based software libraries (all free, open-source, and unrestricted) that allow for rapid, straight-forward, and easy-to-maintain implementation of new ideas and scientific questions. Students will gain awareness and initial working knowledge of some of the most fundamental computational tools for performing a wide variety of academic research. As such, it will focus on providing breadth instead of depth, which means that for each concept we will talk about motivation, key concepts, and concrete usage scenarios, but without exhaustive mathematical background or proofs, which can be acquired in more specialized classes. In this class we will: write programs in python; perform numeric tasks using numpy and scipy; manage data using pandas; discuss audio, image and text processing using scipy.signal, scikit-image, nltk, and pynini; apply machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and autoencoders using scikit-learn and keras; visualize data using matplotlib and pyqtgraph; use pyqt/QT to build graphical user interfaces; address performance issues via compilation/profiling/parallelization tools, and much more. We will also use R for data exploration and visualization."
