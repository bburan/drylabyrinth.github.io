title: "Bioinformatics and Computational Biology I: Algorithms"- 
CRN: "BMI 550/650"
Department: DMICE
Instructor: [Christina Zheng, Ph.D.]
Credits: 4.0
Description: "The course will be a problem-driven examination of the algorithmic issues in computational biology. The course will provide students with the computational fundamentals underlying the techniques covered. Students will be expected to learn basic algorithm principles, basic mathematical and statistical proofs, and molecular biology. The emphasis is on algorithm development and application to biological problems, particularly those from functional genomics studies. Topics will include: Mapping (Genetic linkage maps, physical maps), Sequencing (Whole genome sequencing: shotgun approaches and ESTs), Sequence analysis (multiple sequence alignment, fragment assembly, EST assembly, genome annotation, algorithmic side of gene finding and BLAST). Students will be evaluated on written assignments and a programming project."
Prerequisite: None.
Offering: On Campus Fall
