## Adding your department/group/program to the site

We welcome everyone who wants to participate 

## Adding yourself to the group

We want everyone who is interested to be a member of the Computational Forum, regardless of skill level or interest.

Before you add yourself, open these two links in another tab:

[List of Departments]()
[List of Research Interests]()

Now, fork the repository and create a new branch with your name, such as "ted-laderas". You can do this all on GitHub.

In the `_people` folder, create a new file with your name. Make sure it ends with the `.md` extension, such as `ted-laderas.md`.

Paste the following template into your new file.

```
---
first_name: ""     
last_name: ""
title: "Assistant Professor" #your title
department: ["BME", "comp-bio"] #can have multiple departments
research_interests: ["python", "comp-bio"] #can have multiple interests
github: ""
link: ""

```



## Adding your courses to the list

Coming soon - there will be an editable google sheet that will populate the course list.
